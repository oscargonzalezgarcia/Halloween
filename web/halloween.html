                <p>Halloween is a Celtic tradition which is the celebration of the end of Summer and the Irish harvest.</p>
                <p>It’s a party of Pagan origin which is celebrated the night of the 31st October, which is the All-Saints eve, whose origins are from the old Celtic festival known as “Samhain”. It means “the end of the summer” and it was celebrated when the harvesting time ended in Ireland, to give way to the “new Celtic year”, which coincides with the autumn solstice.</p>
                <p>During that night, it was believed that the dead people’s ghosts walked among the living ones. Parties and sacred rites were ways to communicate with the dead ones. It was also a tradition to place a lit candle on the window, so the dead ones could “find their way”.</p>
