                Decorating your house is another cool way to show others how much you love this celebration. People,
                usually Americans, tend to decorate their houses all the way up. It is somehow similar to Christmas,
                but instead of cool and homely decorations, you’ll see Pumpkins and lots of scarecrows, which are the
                most seen items during the 31st October.
            </p>

            <p>
                Decorating your place doesn’t necessarily mean spending a lot of money, you can actually create a nice
                place with just a tiny bit of money and a lot of creativity! You can give a second chance to the things
                that you already have at home, or buy new items for a reasonably small amount of money. Creativity is
                key, just let your children take part on it and unleash their creativity. Here are some cool ideas to
                customize your
                house in order to make it look creepy!

                    <td>
                        <p> With just a simple pumpking that you can buy for 3$,<br>
                            you can create a very creepy creature using a knife!</p>
                        <p> To light it up, you can use a candle, but it's very important<br>
                            to check the pumpkin from time to time to make sure it<br>
                            hasn't set on fire!
                        </p>

                    <td>
                        <p> If you can't even afford to buy a couple of pumpkins, which<br>
                            by the way is very sad, you can use old bottles and a black<br>
                            marker to create these spooky creatures which will even<br>
                            creep bravest person who notices it!
                        </p>
                        <p> As we mentioned before, please be careful when lighting<br>
                            them up, since they are made out of plastic and can set<br>
                            on fire very easily. That's why we only recommend this<br>
                            idea to experienced firefighters.

                    <td>
                        <p> You can use a couple of black papers and<br>
                            a bit of string to create some spooky bats that will look<br>
                            like they are flying across the room, and also other shapes like<br>
                            pumpkins!
                        </p>
                        <p> You will obviously need some scissors to cut<br>
                            the paper, that's why we advise that adults are the ones that<br>
                            take care of that part, since children, especially the youngest ones<br>
                            might hurt themselves when trying to cut the paper.</p>
